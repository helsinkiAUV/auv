BEFORE YOU BEGIN:
Please make sure you are familiar with basic git usage (see below) and the programming style notes.


WORKFLOW SYNOPSIS:

1. Clone the "auv" repository to the current directory 
   (this only has to be done once on a given computer!):
   $ git clone https://github.com/helsinkiAUV/auv.git

2.0. Edit the files. 
   Make local commits:
   2.1. $ git status # Check the status of the files.
       * Additionally, you can see the differences you've made by
         $ git diff
   2.2. $ git add <file1> [<file2> ...] # Add files to be commited.
       * Use $ git reset <file> to undo.
   2.3. $ git commit # Commit changes to the files. 
       * Write a brief one-liner using your favorite editor of couple of words
         (e.g. "Add minor documentation") and save the file. The files have
         now been committed LOCALLY.
       * To undo: 
         $ git log --stat --summary # View project history.
         $ git reset HEAD~1 # HEAD~N goes back N commits
         -> goto 2.1. and make a better commit.
   2.4. goto 2.0. until the feature has been compeleted. If ready to publish, goto 2.5.
   2.5. Make sure you have no changes to commit. If not, then
        $ git pull --rebase origin master # Synchronize with the GitHub repo. DO THIS BEFORE YOU PUSH!
       * In case of merge conflicts, go talk to the author of the specific file.
   2.6. $ git push origin master # Push changes to GitHub.
       * If the feature doesn't work, keep developing it locally.


NOTES ON PROGRAMMING STYLE:
- Every file must begin with the copyright notice, contain a short description 
  of the file, its author and date of creation.
- Always #include "auv.h" into every file (at least in the body).
- Separate class declaration from the definition. Use headers for documentation
  and .cpp files for the implementation (e.g. Coord.h and Coord.cpp).
- Write all headers within header guards.
- Employ the "const" keyword wherever you can.
- Use (const) references "&" if passing objects; pass primitive types by value where you can.
 * Never use pointers "*".
- Prefer stack allocation. NEVER use the "new" keyword in object construction, 
  only together with dynamic arrays (always new/delete, never malloc/realloc/free).
- Use floats instead of doubles on Arduino (doubles may be used on Raspberry pi).
- Use long and descriptive function and variable names:
 * e.g. "distanceToTarget" instead of "rTar" or something else non-descriptive.
 * No one-character variable names outside of loop iterators!
- Write good function documentation to the header files (see code for examples):
  <function prototype (argument specification may be shortened by "..." if very long>
  PURPOSE: <What does the function do?>
  INPUT:
      <typeIn1> <arg1> : <description of the input (units, range etc.)>
      ...
  OUTPUT:
      (<typeOut1>) <description of the output>
      ...
- Surround code with preprocessor directives so that alternative versions of it can
  be used on Arduino, Raspberry pi and the test suite. For example
  #if defined(RASPBERRY_PI) // Compile for Raspberry pi
  <code for raspi>
  #elif defined(SIMULATOR) // Compile the simulator code
  <simulator code>
  #elif defined(ARDUINO) // Compile for Arduino. Remember to #include "auv.h"
  <Arduino code>
  #endif
